# Intent: inspect_repo

This is an example Obsidian intent note for Phase A testing.

Rules:
- YAML frontmatter is canonical; the Markdown body is ignored by CT.
- Do not store API keys or secrets in the note body or file.

*Created by automation as an example note — move this file into your Obsidian vault (e.g., CT/Intents/) to test the plugin flow.*
