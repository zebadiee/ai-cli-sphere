# Changelog: Bootstrap README added

Date: 2026-01-13

- Added `docs/BOOTSTRAP_README.md` — authoritative control document defining purpose, topology, authority model, exact bootstrap sequence, operating modes, and extension rules.
- This document is the canonical source describing what CT is and what it will never do. Changes to this file are treated as control changes and must follow the Extension Rules.
